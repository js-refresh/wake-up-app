# Wake Up App

## Purpose:
Our front-end project is titled 'Wake Up App' and was created to provide motivation and useful information to a user upon waking up. The idea is to make this concise, not robust, so the user sees only what they care about, with simplicity.  

## Reason/source for each card:
* Quote of the Day card was created to provide a motivational or insightful quote from great leaders and thinkers to engage the users brain upon waking up; this is an API pull from <https://favqs.com/> with JavaScript code written to pull the data.
* The Weather card was created to provide the user with relevant weather information, in case they need to know outside conditions prior to exercise or going to work; this is an API pull from <https://openweathermap.org/> with JavaScript written to pull data.  
* The Stock card was created to provide the user with given stocks for the user to be informed about recent price movements; this is an API pull from <https://twelvedata.com/> with JavaScript and jQuery to pull data and make the card more dynamic. 
* The Project Progress card was created to provide the user with progress from the top projects that the user cares about. A bootstrap template was used to setup initially to provide a static framework and color schemes. JavaScript was written to make the progress bars dynamic, so you can click to update percent complete. Then, local storage was provided so that the users information could be stored locally and re-opened upon page refresh or reopening.

## Reason for color scheme:
* Bright colors chosen for images and text to fulfill morning theme. Dark colors in the background allow the bright colors to stand out a little more and are easier on the eyes, if read in the morning. 

## Ideas for future innovation:
* Add a to-do list for daily tasks
* Add a random recipe generator (API) for users who like to try new foods
* Add an editable short-term, mid-term, long-term goals list to help user focus on upcoming milestones
* Add a linear timescale (across the bottom of the page) and show upcoming milestones and important dates for the user. 
* Add a workout generator card (API) given a few simple parameters for the user (i.e. dumbbells only, no weights, cardio, etc.)
* Add a jokes generator for people who need a laugh to wake up
* Add animation, random gif's, or random inspiring nature photos to the page for additional smiles or inspiration
* Add functionality for user to choose stocks shown on the page   
* Add functionality for the weather card, so the user can search a city of the user's choice
